# Airbnb Clone Backend — Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

## What We Did in This Task

In this task, we designed a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the backend of the Airbnb Clone project based on the features and functionalities identified in Task 1. The DFD visually represents how data moves through the system, highlighting the interactions between users, core backend processes, and the main data entities.

**Key steps:**
- Identified major entities: Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, Admin.
- Mapped out the main processes:
  - User Registration & Authentication
  - Property Management (add/edit/delete)
  - Search & Booking
  - Payment Processing
  - Review Management
  - Admin Operations
- Illustrated the flow of data between external actors (users/admins), backend processes, and data stores.

The diagram helps clarify how user actions translate into backend processes, how data is validated and stored, and how outputs (such as booking confirmations or notifications) are generated.

## Files Included
