## üìå Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management
- **User Registration:** Supports sign-up for both guests and hosts using email/password or OAuth (Google/Facebook).
- **Authentication:** Secure login with JWT tokens, ensuring user sessions are protected.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update personal details, including photos and contact information.

### 2. Property Listings Management
- **Add Listing:** Hosts can create property listings with title, description, location, amenities, price, and availability.
- **Edit/Delete Listing:** Hosts may modify or remove their own property listings.

### 3. Search and Filtering
- **Flexible Search:** Guests can search for properties by location, price, number of guests, and selected amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool).
- **Filtering and Pagination:** Efficient handling of search queries and results, especially for large datasets.

### 4. Booking Management
- **Booking Creation:** Guests can book properties for specific dates, with validation to prevent double bookings.
- **Booking Cancellation:** Both guests and hosts can cancel bookings, subject to the cancellation policy.
- **Booking Status Tracking:** Bookings have clear status states: pending, confirmed, cancelled, or completed.

### 5. Payment Integration
- **Guest Payments:** Secure payment processing via gateways like Stripe or PayPal.
- **Host Payouts:** Automatic distribution of earnings to hosts after bookings are completed.
- **Multi-Currency Support:** Users can transact in different currencies.

### 6. Reviews and Ratings
- **Leave Reviews:** Guests can review properties after stays.
- **Host Responses:** Hosts can respond to guest reviews.
- **Booking-Linked Reviews:** Only guests with actual bookings can leave reviews.

### 7. Notifications System
- **Email & In-App Notifications:** Alerts for booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates.

### 8. Admin Dashboard
- **Monitoring & Management:** Admins can monitor users, listings, bookings, and payments through a dedicated dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

- **Relational Database:** Use PostgreSQL or MySQL with tables for users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments.
- **RESTful APIs:** Expose backend features to the frontend using REST (and optionally GraphQL for complex queries).
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user sessions with JWT and enforce role-based access controls.
- **File Storage:** Store images and profile photos using cloud solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary).
- **Third-Party Services:** Integrate with email services for notifications.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Global error handling for APIs and logging of important events.

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability:** Modular, horizontally scalable architecture with load balancing.
- **Security:** Encryption, firewalls, and rate limiting to protect sensitive data and prevent abuse.
- **Performance:** Caching (e.g., Redis) and optimized database queries for fast response times.
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, and automated API tests to ensure reliability.
