# Airbnb Clone Backend: Use Case Diagram

## What We Did in This Task

We visualized the main interactions between users (Guests, Hosts, Admins) and the Airbnb Clone backend system by designing a Use Case Diagram. This diagram illustrates how different actors interact with key backend functionalities, such as user registration, property listing, searching, booking, payments, and reviews.

Instead of Draw.io, we used PlantUML to create the use case diagram. The PlantUML script (`airbnb-backend-usecase.puml`) is included in this directory for transparency and future edits. The diagram was exported to PNG format so it's easy to view.

**Key Steps:**

1. Identified actors: Guest, Host, Admin.
2. Listed main use cases: Register/Login, Manage Profile, List Properties, Search Properties, Book Properties, Make Payments, Leave Reviews, Manage System (Admin).
3. Captured relationships between each actor and their possible actions.

## How to View/Export
